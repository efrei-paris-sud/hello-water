In the lab, our team have completed the following tasks: LED blinking, breasing LED, active buzzle, RGB LED, analog input.

The code is mainly composed of two methods: the"setup"method and the "loop" method.

By building the circuit on the mini bread and connecting UNO R3 with the coresponding port via jumper wires, we can upload the
code to UNO R3 and mini bread.
